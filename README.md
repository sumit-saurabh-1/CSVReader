# CSVReader


Read a csv in any format to a pojo with a set of columns which may be arranged in any order and read based on column names which are configurable. The csv can still be read if some columns are not present or some extra columns are present. So, NO RESTRICTIONS at all.


HAPPY CSV READING :)
